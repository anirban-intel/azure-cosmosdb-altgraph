# AltGraph

An **alternative graph implementation** built on the **Azure CosmosDB SQL API** and 
**Java** with the **Spring Boot** and **Spring Data** frameworks.

This working reference application is a **refactored version 2.0** of this original repository:</br>
https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-graph-npm-bom-sample

It uses the **Node.js NPM** ecosystem of libraries as a public-domain dataset and an example of a
**Bill-of-Materials (BOM)** business application.
